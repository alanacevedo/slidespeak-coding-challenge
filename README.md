## Michael Acevedo's solution

To run locally:

In backend directory, create a `.env` file with the following content:

```dotenv
API_HOST=0.0.0.0
API_PORT=8000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=xxxxxx__YOUR_ACCESS_KEY__xxxxxxxxx
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxxxxx__YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY__xxxxxxx
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=xxxxxx__YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME__xxxxxxx
AWS_REGION=xxxxxx__YOUR_AWS_REGION__xxxxxxx
PRESIGNED_URL_EXPIRATION_DAYS=5
UNOSERVER_URL=http://unoserver:2004/request
CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://redis:6379/0

```

Then run `docker compose up --build -d`

The conversion API will be available at http://localhost:8000.

In frontend directory, create a `.env.local` file with the following content:

```dotenv
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_HOST=http://localhost:8000
```

Then run `bun run build`, followed by `bun run start`.

The conversion web app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

# SlideSpeak coding challenge: Build a PowerPoint to PDF marketing tool

## The challenge!

Build a front-end implementation as well as a back-end service to convert PowerPoint documents to PDF format. This
should be done by implementing a simple **Next.js** front-end that posts a file to a **Python** server. You donâ€™t have
to do the converting logic yourself as you can use unoconv or unoserver to do this (you can see more about this in the
acceptance criteria). The front-end is also already implemented in the /frontend folder. You only need to add the
necessary logic to switch between the steps and convert the file via the API that you're going to build.

## Acceptance criteria

### Back-end API

-   Should be implemented in Python.
-   Converting PowerPoints to PDF can be done with `unoconv` or `unoserver` via Docker if you want to be fancy ðŸ˜€. You
    donâ€™t need to implement the converting logic yourself.
    -   [Documentation on how to use unoconv and spawn a process](https://pypi.org/project/unoconv/)
        -   Note: `unoconv` is deprecated but thats ok for this challenge
    -   [How to use unoserver via docker](https://gist.github.com/kgoedecke/44955d0b0b1ed4112bcfd3e237e135c0), this will
        create an API that you can use based on [this](https://github.com/libreofficedocker/unoserver-rest-api)
        documentation.
        -   Using unoserver is nice-to-have (but the preferred way), if you find unoconv easier use it instead
-   The API should consist of one endpoint (POST /convert), which should do the following:

    1. Converts the attached file to PDF
    2. Uploads the PowerPoint and PDF file to Amazon S3
       via [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html)
    3. Creates a presigned URL for the user to download

        [https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/s3-presigned-urls.html](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/s3-presigned-urls.html)

        [https://medium.com/@aidan.hallett/securing-aws-s3-uploads-using-presigned-urls-aa821c13ae8d](https://medium.com/@aidan.hallett/securing-aws-s3-uploads-using-presigned-urls-aa821c13ae8d)

    4. Returns the presigned S3 url to the client which allows the user to download the file (by opening the url in new
       tab)

### Front-end app

-   The front-end should in terms of UX work similarly
    to [https://app.slidespeak.co/powerpoint-optimizer](https://app.slidespeak.co/powerpoint-optimizer)

## Nice to haves / tips

-   Uses unoserver to convert PowerPoint to PDF via docker compose
-   The logic of the front-end ideally should not rely on useEffect too much since it can be difficult to track what is
    happening
-   Tests
-   Use conventional commit message style: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
-   Lint your code
-   Keep commits clean
-   If you want to be really fancy you can add queuing with Celery
